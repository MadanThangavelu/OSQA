OSQA
====

A read-only git mirror of the official OSQA SVN repository (http://svn.osqa.net/svnroot/osqa/trunk). Only trunk is mirrored into master branch. The current state should reflect the actual SVN code delayed by a couple of minutes. For live preview check http://svn.osqa.net/. This is only intended as an easy way to fork from OSQA codebase. This mirror is maintained by a community member and is not officially endorsed by OSQA team.
